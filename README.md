This was my project exam 1 where i had to create a blog website. 


## Description

Brief

You have been tasked with creating a blog site. You can choose the design and topics covered on the blog, but it should have at least the following pages:
- Home page
- About page
- List of blog posts
- Blog post specific pages
- Contact page.

Home Page
The home page should feature a 'Latest Posts' section, designed as a carousel (slider) for the desktop version. As an example, you could display four posts at a time, although you're welcome to adjust this number to better suit your design. Users should be able to click an arrow on the right to scroll through to the next set of posts, and an arrow on the left to view the previous set. For the mobile version, you are free to alter the layout as you deem appropriate, without being tied to a carousel format.

Blog Page
The blog posts page should show the first 10 blogs, and the user should click to view more results which then show underneath the first 10 blogs.

Blog Specific Page
The content of the blog specific page should be dynamically built using a query string parameter based on whatever link the user clicked. The title of the blog specific page should change based on the blog that has been clicked on e.g. “My Blog | An Article I Wrote”.

If images on the blog specific page are clicked, a modal should appear giving the user a bigger view of that image. Clicking outside the image should hide the modal.

Contact page
Create a contact us page, there should be 4 textboxes on this page.

Name (Should be more than 5 characters long)
Email address (Must be a valid email address)
Subject (Should be more than 15 characters long)
Message content (Should be more than 25 characters long)
Please use JavaScript for validation, show error messages if the values in the textboxes do not meet the requirements.

WordPress
The content for your website will be stored on a WordPress installation used as a Headless CMS. It’s important to note that we are only using WordPress to provide an API and add content for the blog. You should not submit a link to a WordPress site, but build your website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and making a call to the WordPress REST API to fetch the data.


The steps i took in the development of this project:

- Designing the website
- Writing the html and css code
- Testing the site for Web accessibility and SEO
- Make the website responsive for all device screens
- Create a headless Wordpress installation in order to manage the sites API
- Make API calls to the headless Wordpress in order to fetch the data and display it on the site
